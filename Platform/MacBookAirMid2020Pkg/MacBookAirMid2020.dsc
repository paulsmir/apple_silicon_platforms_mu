# DeviceFamilyAcpiTables.inf was never built, so AcpiPlatformDxe asserted looking for the
# device family tables, and the family's display/console PCDs were never applied either.

# Trim the debug output. The MemoryAttributesTable dump and the GCD memory space maps run
# to hundreds of lines each and are emitted right at ReadyToBoot, drowning out exactly the
# part we need to see: whether BDS calls StartImage for Boot0003 (Internal UEFI Shell) and
# what it returns. Keep ERROR/WARN/INIT/LOAD/INFO/BM, drop VERBOSE, GCD, POOL and PAGE.

# DebugLib here is MdePkg/BaseDebugLibSerialPort, which honours this PCD.

  # EfiBootManagerBoot() -> BmSetMemoryTypeInformationVariable() does a warm reset when the
  # memory type information changes, so that the new pool sizes take effect. On real
  # hardware that happens once: the variable persists and the next boot proceeds.
  #
  # Here there is no non-volatile variable storage -- the firmware is reloaded into RAM on
  # every run -- so the variable is always "missing", and the machine reset forever, always
  # before StartImage (hence no "Booting ..." line ever appeared in the log). Confirmed by
  # instrumenting RuntimeServiceResetSystem: "RESET CALLED: type=1 status=Success
  # caller=0x9DDB426DC" resolved to EfiBootManagerBoot +0xa2c.
